# Plutus Project Standard Assessment Guide
A series of questions to guide the projects to adhere to open source standards

## 0 Introduction
This guideline is used to assess the open-source conformity of collaborated projects in different ALGOTRADE Training Programs, including:
- Algo Researcher
- Internship
- Algorithmic Trading Course
- and collaborated University Thesis Project.

Below listed the requirement of each aspects of an ready-to-publish open-source project. There are current seven (7) aspects:
1. Documentation
2. Coding
3. Data
4. Abstraction
5. Backtesting
6. Optimization
7. Paper Trading


## 1 Documentation
### 1.1 Requirement
- The project should be hosted on [ALGOTRADE Plutus organization in Github](https://github.com/algotrade-research).
- The project should have a `README.md` file
- And a Final Report (or Paper)

in the Github repo.

### 1.2 The README.md
Each Github repository have a `README.md` file contains the overall information of the project. The file is put in the root folder of the project, refers to the repository [`plutus-project-template`](https://github.com/algotrade-research/plutus-project-template) for more information.

The idea of the `README.md` is to provide the reader of the repositoty how to **RUN** and **REPLICATE** the result(s) of this project. Hence, these sections are the focuses of this file:
- `Data`: can be brief, but understandable and clear how to get the data to replicate the results
- `Implementation`: most important, show how to run and replicate the project
- `In-sample Backtesting` to `Paper Trading`: second most important, show how to do the step in development the algorithms and the associated results.

The structure of the specific `README.md` file can deviate from the template presented below depends on the situation. Nevertheless, the file should provide the reader a clear instruction and an accurate overview about the project.

Below is the template of the `README.md`:
- Has an `Abstract` to summarize the project, the motivation, the methods, and the findings in less than 5 sentences.
- Has an `Introduction` section to briefly talk about the project. Content of this section can be:
    - The motivation to do the project (answering the "Why?" question)
    - An overview of the method conducted in this project (answering the "How" question)
    - The goal of the project (answering the "What" question)
    - This section in `README.md` file should be brief. Only 1-2 paragraphs is sufficient. Details are put in the Final Report/Paper.
- Has a (optional) `Related Work` or `Background` section to briefly introduce the prerequisite reading if the audience needs knowledge before exploring the project.
- Has at least sections to briefly discuss from `Step 1: Forming Trading Hypotheses` to `Step 6: Out-of-sample Backtesting` (or `Step 7: Paper Trading`) of the [Nine-Step process](https://hub.algotrade.vn/knowledge-hub/steps-to-develop-a-trading-algorithm/):
    - Should have a section to discuss the `Trading (Algorithm) Hypotheses` (Step 1).
    - Should have a section to discuss the `Data` (Step 2: Data Collection and Step 3: Data Processing)
    - Should have a section to present the `Implementation` (or `How to Run`) of the trading algorithm
    - Should have a section to discuss the `In-sample Backtesting` (Step 4)
    - Should have a section to discuss the `Optimization` (Step 5)
    - Should have a section to discuss the `Out-of-sample Backtesting` (Step 6) 
    - Should have a section to discuss the `Paper Trading` (Step 7), if there is
- The `Data` section should has 2 subsections:
    - `Data Collection` to discuss the Step 2
    - `Data Processing` to discuss the Step 3
    - Some questions need to be answered in this section:
        - What is the data: Period of data, format, structure, type, etc.?
        - How to input the configuration?
        - How to store the output data?
- The `Implementation` or (`How to run`) should present:
    - How to set up the enviroment to run the source code and required steps to replicate the results
    - Discuss the concrete implementation if there are any essential details
    - How to run each step from `In-sample Backtesting`, Step 4 to `Out-of-sample Backtesting`, Step 6 (or `Paper Trading`, Step 7).
    - How to change the algorithm configurations for different run.
- In each section from the `In-sample Backtesting` to the `Paper Trading`:
    - Specify the standard (or sample) set of parameters, input data, and the corresponding output.
    - There should be a subsection `Result` to present and discuss the results.
- In this `README.md`, the `Result` subsection of each steps:
    - Should only briefly shown the output results, such as tables and images. The link to the report of each step (4-7) should be presented also.
- The complete set of parameters, input data, and output of all the experiments examined in the project should be mentioned in a separate section but not in the README.md file. Preferred these information is put into the **Final Report** or **Paper**.
- Has a (optional) `Conclusion` section.
- Has a `Reference` section to mention the references.
- A link to the Final Report/Paper
    - Show how to compile the document if it is written in a language like LaTex.
- Be reasonably easy to follow.

### 1.3 The Final Report/Paper
- This document contains all the same sections as the `README.md` file but in more in-depth details. Note that the `Related Work` (or `Backrgound`), and `Conclusion` sections are **NOT** optional in the final report.
- If the final document was written in software such as LaTex, it should be included in the project's GitHub repository and the source to compile it.
- The final document should contain adequate information to understand the project. It should contain documentation reproducing the result up to:
    - Minimally, Step 6: Out-of-sample Backtesting
    - Ideally, Step 7: Paper Trading
    
    of the [Nine-Step process](https://hub.algotrade.vn/knowledge-hub/steps-to-develop-a-trading-algorithm/).


## 2 Coding
### 2.1 Requirement
- There should be unit tests and test cases in essential functions and classes.

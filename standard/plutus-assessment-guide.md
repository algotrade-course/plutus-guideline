# Plutus Project Standard Assessment Guide
A series of questions to guide the projects to adhere to open source standards

## 0 Introduction
This guideline is used to assess the open-source conformity of collaborated projects in different ALGOTRADE Training Programs, including:
- Algo Researcher
- Internship
- Algorithmic Trading Course
- and collaborated University Thesis Project.

Below listed the requirement of each aspects of an ready-to-publish open-source project. There are current seven (7) aspects:
1. Documentation
2. Coding
3. Data
4. Abstraction
5. Backtesting
6. Optimization
7. Paper Trading


## 1 Documentation
Please refer to the [PLUTUS Standard `README.md`](../README.md) file.

## 2 Coding
### 2.1 Requirement
- There should be unit tests and test cases in essential functions and classes.
- The project should use a version control system, be hosted in a service like GitHub, and be easy to access.
- There should be documentation of the code and docstring in essential functions and classes.
    - The docstring is preferred to follow guidelines such as [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
- Code should be structured into proper classes and functions.
- Functions should be short, serve only one purpose, or be simple enough to reuse.
- The code should be easy to understand and extendable.
- The log during runtime (backtest and paper trade) should be concise. Third-party library logs, such as optimization library Optuna, should be suppressed and only show if necessary. The third-party logs can be pushed to debug logging.
### 2.2 Example question to ask (to be revised)
- Is the project accessible through a version control system such as Git and shared through a platform such as GitHub?
- Are there test cases?
- Is there documentation of the code?
- Did objects structure into proper class?
- Did the function serve only one purpose, or was it simple enough to reuse?
- Is the project easy to extend if needed? If yes, what are the good points? If not, what are the shortcomings?
- Is the logging during runtime concise?


## 3 Data
### 3.1 Requirement
- The README.md file should include instructions on how to get the input data and how to store the output data.
- The type of data and the minimum size should be mentioned so that the model makes sense (1 week? 2 months? 3 years?).
- What kind of output data and where it is stored should also be mentioned.
- The expected output, standard input, and standard parameters should be documented.

### 3.2 Example question to ask
- What is the source of the data?
- How does the project access to the data:
    - APIs, streaming, or batch download?
    - Database, external, or Algotradeâ€™s?
- What type of data?
- Data period?
- How does the project manage the output data?
    - Does it store it in a database? In spreadsheet files? Or in binary files? etc.

## 4 Abstraction
Hard to do, so optional at the moment
### 4.1 Requirement
- Use some level of abstraction for basic execution phase objects such as orders, transactions, positions, portfolios, etc.
- Use some level of abstraction for the input data objects
- Use some level of abstraction for the output data objects
- Have a class to unify the evaluation of the algorithm in backtesting, paper trading and real trading
### 4.1.1 Optional
- Use abstraction to separate between bot and algorithm
- Use structure to unify backtest and paper trading

## 4.2 Example question to ask (to be revised)
- Did the project use some abstraction of objects such as order, transaction, position, portfolio, etc.?
- Did the project separate between bot and algorithm?
- Did the project use the same code structure to backtest and paper trade the algorithm?
- Is there a clear method to use to evaluate the algorithm?


## 5 Backtesting
Can use this [form](standard/report-form/backtesting/backtesting-report-form.pdf) ([LaTeX source](standard/report-form/backtesting/backtesting-report-form-source.zip)) to generate the Backtesting Report
### 5.1 Requirement
- The backtest function should be easy to run (one click).
- The backtest function should make it easy to change the parameters.
- If the backtest report is written in a language like LaTex, it should be easy to reproduce. The code to produce the report should be included in the repository.
- The backtest report should include each dataset's running time and configuration parameters.
- Evaluation methods should be put in a single package or class.
- The output of the backtest and the evaluation metrics should be briefly mentioned in the README.md file.
- There should be a file containing all the parameters and settings of the backtest along with the associated data.

### 5.2 Example question to ask (to be revised)
- Is the backtest function easy to run (e.g., one or two clicks)?
- Is the backtest function easy to change the parameters?
- Can the backtest report be reproduced? Is the production backtest report embedded into the backtest code?
- Is the running time of each dataset and parameter reported?
- Are these evaluation methods put into a single package or functions to easily access the code?
- How does the project handle the data structure for running backtesting?


## 6 Optimization
Can use this [form](standard/report-form/optimization/optimization-report-form.pdf) ([LaTeX source](standard/report-form/optimization/optimization-report-form-source.zip)) to generate the Optimization Report
### 6.1 Requirement
- The optimization functions should be structured into one class or package
- The optimization functions should be easy to understand, implement standard methods, or use a well-known black box library. If new optimization methods are implemented, unit tests and test cases should be used to ensure the correctness of the function. - - - Documentation of the newly invented optimization methods should be written as well.
- The optimization procedure should be clearly described, and the optimized results should be detailed and reported to ensure no overfitting.

### 6.2 Example question to ask (to be revised)
- Is the optimization procedure in a separate package or structured into one class?
- What is the optimization procedure? Is it a well-known method or from a well-known package?
    - If not, is there any documentation to provide rationale and test cases to ensure there will be no overfitting?
- Is the whole optimization process well documented and reported? Are there any flaws in the procedure that could lead to overfitting?


## 7 Paper Trading
Can use this [form](standard/report-form/paper-trading/papertrading-report-form.pdf) ([LaTeX source](standard/report-form/paper-trading/papertrading-report-form-source.zip)) to generate the Paper Trading Report
### 7.1 Requirement
- The results of the paper trading should be well documented.
    - The data source.
    - The period
    - The financial instrument(s)
    - The results
- The input and output data of the paper trading should be clearly described:
    - Where to store the output data.
    - The type of the output data.
    - The result and meaning of the output data.
### 7.1.1 Optional
- Backtest and paper trade code should be the same (using the same structure, classes, and methods)

### 7.2 Example question to ask (to be revised)
- How did the project manage the differences between backtest data and live trade data?
- Is the paper trading report production embedded into the code?
- How does the project handle paper trading data? Database? Spreadsheet file? Binary data?
- How does the project handle the data structure for paper trading?
